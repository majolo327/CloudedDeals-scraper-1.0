# Operations

**This file has been consolidated into the root [`OPERATIONS.md`](../../OPERATIONS.md).**

All operational documentation — coverage tables, platform status, anti-bot
stack, pipeline architecture, monitoring, and beta lock policy — lives in the
single authoritative file at the repository root.
