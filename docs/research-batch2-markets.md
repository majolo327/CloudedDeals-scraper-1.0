# Market Research: Batch 2 — Next 3 Expansion Markets

*Compiled: Feb 2026 | CloudedDeals Multi-State Expansion — Phase 2*

---

## Executive Summary

After evaluating 8 candidate US cannabis markets on market maturity, platform overlap, population density, data accessibility, and strategic value, we recommend **Arizona, Missouri, and New Jersey** as the Batch 2 expansion markets.

- **Arizona:** Mature market, massive Dutchie adoption, MSO density, tourist traffic
- **Missouri:** Fastest-growing new market, strong Dutchie/Jane adoption, underserved by deal platforms
- **New Jersey:** NYC metro spillover, MSO-dominated (familiar patterns), high prices = deal-seeking consumers

Colorado and Ohio were strong contenders but ranked lower due to market fragmentation (CO) and platform immaturity (OH).

| **Curaleaf Arizona** | 8-10 | **Curaleaf Platform** | curaleaf.com/stores/curaleaf-az-* |
| **Zen Leaf Arizona** (Verano) | 5-6 | **Zen Leaf Platform** | Same as NV curaleaf.py |
| **Rise Arizona** (GTI) | 3-4 | **Rise Platform** | risecannabis.com AZ locations |
| **Sol Flower** | 5+ | **Dutchie** | Dutchie embed confirmed |

| **JARS Cannabis AZ** | 3+ | **Dutchie** | Same as MI JARS |
| **Various independents** | 80+ | Mixed | ~60% Dutchie, 20% Jane, 20% other |

**Platform coverage:** ~70-80% supported (Dutchie dominant, strong Jane secondary)

#### Brand Ecosystem
- **National brands strong:** STIIIZY, Cookies, Alien Labs, Connected, Jeeter, Raw Garden, Select
- **AZ-native brands:** Abundant Organics, Tru|Med, Grow Sciences, Ponderosa, Item 9 Labs, Venom Extracts, Timeless Vapes, Aeriz
- **NV brand overlap:** Very high (~40+ brands shared); lowest net-new brand count of any expansion market
- **Net-new brands needed:** ~20-25

#### Technical Notes
- **Prices:** Similar to Nevada (moderate). Flower eighths $25-50, carts $25-45
- **Price caps:** NV caps may work with minor adjustments
- **Scrapeability:** High — Dutchie-dominant, standard age gates, no aggressive bot protection
- **Tourist market:** Scottsdale/Sedona/Flagstaff create deal-seeking behavior similar to Vegas

#### Why #1
- Highest platform overlap (70-80%) = lowest engineering effort
- Highest brand overlap = lowest brand DB expansion needed
- Tourist-driven deal-seeking behavior matches CloudedDeals value prop
- Same price range as NV = minimal scoring model changes
- Trulieve/Harvest (20+ locations) alone gives instant critical mass

### 2B. Missouri (Score: 38/50) — RECOMMENDED #2

#### Market Overview
- **Legalization:** Recreational Feb 2023 (Amendment 3)
- **Operational dispensaries:** ~200+ licensed retail locations (rapidly growing)
- **Market revenue:** ~$1.5B+ annually (fastest growth rate in US)
- **Key metros:** St. Louis (60+), Kansas City (40+), Springfield (15+), Columbia (10+), Joplin (10+)

#### Dispensary Landscape

| Chain | Locations | Platform | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Proper Cannabis** | 5+ | **Dutchie** | Major MO brand; propercannabis.com uses Dutchie |
| **Swade** | 5+ | **Dutchie** | swade.com embeds Dutchie |
| **BeLeaf Medical** | 3+ | **Dutchie** | Dutchie presence confirmed |
| **C4 Cannabis** | 3+ | **Jane** | iheartjane embed |
| **BLOC** | 3+ | **Dutchie** | Dutchie embed |

| **Zen Leaf Missouri** | 3-4 | **Zen Leaf Platform** | Same as NV |
| **Various independents** | 100+ | Mixed | ~50% Dutchie, 25% Jane, 25% other |

**Platform coverage:** ~65-75% supported (Dutchie dominant)

#### Brand Ecosystem
- **MO-native brands:** Proper Cannabis, Sinse, Illicit Gardens, BeLeaf, Ostara, C4, Heartland Labs, Good Day Farms, Flora Farms
- **National brands present:** STIIIZY (entering), Cookies, Wana, Kiva, WYLD
- **MSO brands:** Rhythm (GTI), Verano, Select (Curaleaf)
- **Net-new brands needed:** ~30-35

#### Technical Notes
- **Prices:** Moderate-to-low. Flower eighths $20-40, carts $20-40, edibles $15-25
- **Price caps:** Between NV and MI levels; minor cap adjustments needed
- **Scrapeability:** Good — newer market = newer websites = more standardized Dutchie/Jane adoption
- **Border traffic:** Kansas (illegal), Oklahoma (legal but separate), Arkansas (medical), Illinois (rec) — less border-driven than MI

#### Why #2
- Fastest-growing US market = early-mover advantage for CloudedDeals
- Strong Dutchie/Jane adoption (65-75%) = existing scrapers work
- No established deal aggregator competitor in Missouri
- Mix of MSO chains (Rise, Curaleaf, Zen Leaf = reusable patterns) + native brands
- Price-conscious consumers (MO is not a high-income market) = strong deal-seeking behavior

---

### 2C. New Jersey (Score: 38/50) — RECOMMENDED #3

#### Market Overview
- **Legalization:** Recreational Apr 2022 (sales began)
- **Operational dispensaries:** ~130-150 licensed retail locations (growing as conditional licenses open)
- **Market revenue:** ~$1.0B+ annually
- **Key metros:** Northern NJ / NYC metro (60+), Central NJ (30+), Southern NJ / Philly metro (20+), Shore (10+)

#### Dispensary Landscape

| Chain | Locations | Platform | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Curaleaf New Jersey** | 6-8 | **Curaleaf Platform** | curaleaf.com/stores/curaleaf-nj-* |
| **Zen Leaf NJ** (Verano) | 4-5 | **Zen Leaf Platform** | Same as NV |
| **Rise NJ** (GTI) | 3-4 | **Rise Platform** | risecannabis.com NJ locations |
| **Ascend NJ** | 4-5 | **Dutchie** | letsascend.com Dutchie embed |
| **Columbia Care/Cannabist NJ** | 3-4 | **Dutchie** | Dutchie embed |
| **Apothecarium** (TerrAscend) | 3-4 | **Dutchie** | Dutchie embed |
| **RISE** | 3-4 | **Rise Platform** | Same as NV rise.py |
| **The Botanist** (Acreage) | 3+ | **Jane** | iheartjane embed |
| **Garden State Dispensary** | 3+ | **Jane** | Jane embed |
| **Various independents** | 60+ | Mixed | ~40% Dutchie, 25% Jane, 20% Curaleaf/Rise, 15% other |

**Platform coverage:** ~70-80% supported (MSO-heavy = high platform overlap)

#### Brand Ecosystem
- **MSO-dominated:** Same brands as IL (Rhythm, Cresco, Verano, Ozone, Select)
- **NJ-native brands:** Kind Tree (TerrAscend), Garden State Canna, Gage (NJ), Breakwater
- **National brands entering:** Cookies, STIIIZY, Jeeter
- **Net-new brands needed:** ~15-20 (highest overlap with existing IL/NV brands)

#### Technical Notes
- **Prices:** High (similar to IL). Flower eighths $45-60, carts $40-55, edibles $25-40
- **Price caps:** Need IL-level caps (high price market)
- **Scrapeability:** Good — MSO-heavy means websites follow standard patterns we already handle
- **NYC metro spillover:** Massive population base (20M+) with limited NJ stores = high deal-seeking demand

#### Why #3
- MSO-dominated = highest reuse of existing scrapers (Curaleaf, Rise, Zen Leaf patterns identical)
- Lowest net-new brand count (~15-20) due to shared MSO brand portfolios with IL/NV
- NYC metro population (20M+) is the largest underserved cannabis consumer base in the US
- High prices = strong consumer motivation to find deals
- Complement to IL research (same MSO brands, similar pricing, overlapping platform patterns)

## 3. Markets Not Selected (Rationale)

### Colorado (Score: 39/50 — Strong but #4)
- **Pros:** Oldest market, 600+ dispensaries, massive scale
- **Cons:** Extremely fragmented (hundreds of independent operators, low chain density), diverse platform mix (many custom/proprietary), existing deal aggregators like Cannasaver already operate in CO
- **Defer because:** Fragmentation = highest engineering effort per dispensary; competitive landscape is more crowded

### Ohio (Score: 35/50)
- **Pros:** Large population (11.8M), newest rec market (Aug 2024), growing fast
- **Cons:** Still early — only ~90-100 operational dispensaries, many converting from medical; platform adoption still shifting; limited brand diversity (MSO-dominated but fewer options)
- **Defer because:** Market too early; revisit in 12-18 months when dispensary count stabilizes at 200+

### Maryland (Score: 33/50)
- **Pros:** DC metro population, rec started Jul 2023, growing
- **Cons:** Small market (~100 dispensaries), limited brand diversity, niche regional market
- **Defer because:** Too small to justify standalone research; could piggyback with NJ expansion later

### New York (Score: 31/50)
- **Pros:** Largest potential market in US (20M+ population), massive tourist traffic
- **Cons:** Extremely problematic rollout — only ~50-70 licensed dispensaries operational despite 3+ years; ongoing legal challenges; CAURD (Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary) program plagued by lawsuits; many operators using basic/custom websites; illicit market remains dominant
- **Defer because:** Market infrastructure too immature; revisit in 24+ months when licensing stabilizes

### Pennsylvania (Score: 31/50)
- **Pros:** 6th largest state by population, 100+ medical dispensaries, may go recreational
- **Cons:** **Medical-only** — no recreational sales; medical menus are more restrictive; patient-only access limits deal-seeking behavior; recreational legalization uncertain (2025-2026 legislative push)
- **Defer because:** No recreational market yet; monitor legislative progress

## 5. Combined Batch 2 Platform Coverage Matrix

| Platform | AZ | MO | NJ | Total New | Our Scraper |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dutchie** | ~120 | ~130 | ~35 | ~285 | **Supported** |
| **Jane** | ~30 | ~40 | ~20 | ~90 | **Supported** |
| **Curaleaf** | ~10 | ~3 | ~8 | ~21 | **Supported** |
| **Zen Leaf/Verano** | ~6 | ~4 | ~5 | ~15 | **Supported** |
| **Rise/GTI** | ~4 | ~3 | ~4 | ~11 | **Supported** |
| **Weedmaps** | ~15 | ~15 | ~5 | ~35 | Not supported |
| **Custom/Other** | ~10 | ~15 | ~10 | ~35 | Not supported |
| **TOTAL** | ~195 | ~210 | ~87 | **~492** | |
| **Supported %** | ~87% | ~86% | ~83% | **~86%** | |

**Key insight:** All three Batch 2 markets have 83-87% platform overlap with existing scrapers. Combined with MI+IL, we'd have **5 new states, ~1,100+ addressable dispensaries** using existing scraper infrastructure.

---

## 6. New Scraper Requirements Across All 5 States

| New Scraper | States | Dispensaries | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sunnyside (Cresco)** | IL only | ~15 | P1 (IL #1 MSO) |
| **Weedmaps Embed** | MI, AZ, MO, NJ | ~165 combined | P2 (biggest gap by volume) |
| **Meadow POS** | MI mainly | ~30-40 | P3 (MI independents) |
| **Custom/Proprietary** | All states | ~100+ | P4 (case-by-case evaluation) |

**Recommended scraper build order:**
1. Sunnyside — unlock IL's #1 MSO (15 locations, single platform)
2. Weedmaps embed — unlock ~165 dispensaries across 4 states (high ROI)
3. Everything else — as-needed per market demand
