# CloudedDeals Vegas Strip QR Flyer Campaign

## Ready-to-Order Guerilla Beta Test Plan

---

## THE FLYER — DESIGN SPEC

### Format
- **Size:** Quarter sheet (4.25" x 5.5") — pocket-sized, cheap to print, easy to hand out fast
- **Sides:** Single-sided (keeps cost down, one glance is all you get with tourists anyway)
- **Color:** Black ink on WHITE paper (cheapest possible, high contrast for QR readability)
- **Paper:** 20lb bond or 60lb offset (lightweight, cheap, disposable — this is guerilla, not a wedding invite)

### Layout (Top to Bottom)

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐

### Design Notes

1. **QR Code must link to:** `https://cloudeddeals.com?utm_source=flyer&utm_medium=qr&utm_campaign=vegas_strip_beta`
   - This UTM tracking lets you measure exactly how many scans convert
   - Test the QR code on 3+ different phones before sending to print

2. **QR code size:** At least 1.2" x 1.2" on a quarter sheet. Bigger is better. Tourists will scan this in bright sunlight, possibly tipsy. Make it easy.

3. **"cloudeddeals.com" in plain text below the QR** — some people don't trust QR codes, some older phones struggle. Give them the URL to type.

4. **No clutter.** Resist the urge to add more. A tourist on the strip has 1.5 seconds of attention. The entire flyer should be readable in that time.

5. **Black on white** prints the sharpest QR code. Color QR codes on cheap paper risk scan failures. Don't risk it on a $0.01 flyer.

## COPY — FINAL TEXT (exactly what goes on the flyer)

**Headline (top, biggest):**
```
STOP OVERPAYING FOR WEED.
```

**Tagline (below headline):**
```
Every deal. Every dispensary. One place.
```

**Below QR code:**
```
cloudeddeals.com
```

**Body (below QR, smaller text):**
```
63 Vegas dispensaries. Updated every morning.
100% free. No app needed. Just scan.
```

**Bottom (brand):**
```
CLOUDED DEALS
```

That's it. Nothing else. Every word earns its space.

## WHY THIS DESIGN CONVERTS

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| "Stop overpaying for weed" | Direct pain point. Every tourist buying weed in Vegas is overpaying and knows it. Strip dispensaries charge 2-3x. This hits them where it hurts. |
| Quarter sheet size | Fits in a pocket. People keep it instead of trashing it immediately. They scan later at the hotel. |
| "63 dispensaries" | Specific number = credibility. Not "all dispensaries" which sounds like marketing BS. 63 is real. |
| "Updated every morning" | Implies freshness. Today's deals, not stale info. |
| "No app needed" | Removes friction. Tourists don't want to download another app. This is a website — scan and go. |
| "100% free" | Removes suspicion. No catch. |
| Single-sided B&W | Tourists glance at one side. If it's double-sided, 50% see the wrong side first. B&W feels underground/authentic, not corporate. |

## PRINTING — WHERE TO ORDER

### Budget Reality Check

$100 for 10,000-20,000 flyers = $0.005-$0.01 per flyer. That's extremely tight for professional printing. Here's how to actually make it work:

### OPTION A: Online Bulk (Best Price, 2-5 Day Ship) — RECOMMENDED

| Vendor | Product | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **[ZoePrint](https://www.zoeprint.com/product/cheap-flyer-printing-black-and-white-425x55)** | 4.25x5.5 B&W flyers — dedicated product for exactly this size and format | Go to link, select 10,000 qty, 20lb bond, single-sided, get quote |
| **[PrintPlace](https://www.printplace.com/cheap-flyers)** | Advertises starting at 2¢/piece for 10K+ qty | Use their calculator: 4.25x5.5 or closest size, B&W, lightest paper |
| **[PrintIt4Less](https://www.printit4less.com/product/flyer-black-white/)** | Dedicated B&W flyer product, "guaranteed lowest cost" | Configure for quarter page, 10K qty — call 1-800-370-5591 for bulk quote |
| **[55printing.com](https://www.55printing.com/cheap-flyers-printing/)** | 24+ sizes including 4.25x5.5, B&W option, free design included | Select size, B&W, 10K qty. Free design help if you need layout done |
| **[A Good Sign](https://agoodsignabq.com/product/handbills-quarter-sheet-flyers-black-ink/)** | "Handbills/Quarter Sheet" — literally built for this use case | Configure for 10K black ink handbills |
| **[PrintPapa](https://www.printpapa.com/eshop/pc/Flyer-Qtr-Page-4-25x5-5-661p1948.htm)** | Quarter page 4.25x5.5, quantities up to 100K | Select B&W, lightest paper, 10K qty |

**How to get under $100:**
- Choose the lightest paper (20lb bond)
- Single-sided only
- Black ink only (no color)
- Standard turnaround (not rush)
- If 10K is over budget, 5K might land under $100 and that's still plenty for a beta test

### OPTION B: Same-Day Local Vegas Printing (Costs More, Instant)

If you're already in Vegas or need them NOW:

| Shop | Phone | Address | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| **[Design One Printing](https://designoneprinting.com/flyer/)** | 702-530-6277 | Las Vegas & Henderson | Same-day flyers, call for bulk quote |
| **[Digital Insight Printing](https://digitalinsightprinting.com/flyers-prd)** | Check site | Las Vegas & Henderson | Order by 12PM for same-day pickup |
| **[Sunrise Printing](https://sunriseprintinglv.com/)** | Check site | 3945 E Patrick Ln, LV 89120 | Same-day if ordered by 10AM, Mon-Fri 8-4, Sat 8-12 |
| **[RushMyPrints](https://www.rushmyprints.com/las-vegas-printing-services/)** | Check site | Las Vegas & North LV | 24-hour print shop |

**Local reality:** Same-day in Vegas will run more like $200-400 for 10K. But you can negotiate. Call and say "I need 10,000 quarter sheet handbills, black and white, single sided, cheapest paper you've got." They'll quote you.

**Compromise:** Print 2,000-3,000 locally for same-day at ~$80-120, then order 10K-20K online at bulk pricing for the next wave.

### OPTION C: Self-Print (Cheapest Possible, DIY)

If you have access to a laser printer or can use a FedEx/Staples self-service:
- 4 quarter sheets per letter-size page
- 10,000 flyers = 2,500 pages
- B&W self-service at Staples/FedEx: ~$0.09-0.14/page = $225-350 (over budget)
- If you know someone with a laser printer and can buy bulk paper: ~$30 for 2,500 sheets of paper + toner

Not recommended unless you have printer access. The per-page math doesn't work at copy shops.

## RECOMMENDED ORDER (what I'd actually do)

**Step 1:** Go to [ZoePrint B&W 4.25x5.5](https://www.zoeprint.com/product/cheap-flyer-printing-black-and-white-425x55) and [PrintPlace](https://www.printplace.com/cheap-flyers). Get quotes for 10,000 and 5,000 qty. Pick whoever is cheapest with standard shipping.

**Step 2:** If you need flyers THIS WEEK and are in Vegas, call Design One Printing (702-530-6277) and ask for a quote on 2,000-3,000 quarter sheet B&W handbills for immediate pickup. Should be $60-100 range.

**Step 3:** Use both. Hand out the local batch immediately as your first wave, then the online bulk order arrives for sustained distribution.

## QR CODE GENERATION

Generate your QR code for free:

1. Go to any free QR generator (qr-code-generator.com, qrcode-monkey.com, etc.)
2. Enter URL: `https://cloudeddeals.com?utm_source=flyer&utm_medium=qr&utm_campaign=vegas_strip_beta`
3. Download as **PNG at 300 DPI minimum** (for print quality)
4. Use the plain black-on-white version. No fancy colors or embedded logos — those reduce scan reliability on cheap paper
5. **Test it** on at least 3 phones before sending to printer

---

## DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY — STRIP DEPLOYMENT

### Where to Hand Out

**High-traffic tourist zones (walk these on foot):**
- Las Vegas Blvd between Mandalay Bay and The STRAT (the main strip)
- Fremont Street Experience (downtown, heavy foot traffic at night)
- Outside Planet 13 (the "largest dispensary in the world" — tourists literally walking to buy weed)
- Near dispensary clusters on Industrial Rd / Western Ave
- Convention center areas during any active conventions
- Hotel casino entrances and exits (technically on public sidewalk)

**Best times:**
- Thursday-Saturday, 7PM-12AM (peak tourist foot traffic)
- Friday-Sunday afternoon, 2PM-6PM (people heading out for the night)
- During major events/conventions (CES, fight weekends, EDC, etc.)

### How to Hand Out

- Lead with the hook: "Hey, looking for weed deals?" or "Stop overpaying for weed" (said out loud)
- Don't be pushy — offer, don't force. One hand out, one sentence, move on
- Tourists expect being handed things on the strip (they're used to the nightclub promoter guys)
- Wear something branded if possible (even a basic black tee with "cloudeddeals.com" on it)
- Target people who look like they're browsing/walking, not people rushing somewhere

### Legal Notes

- Las Vegas allows handbilling on public sidewalks (First Amendment activity)
- Stay on public sidewalks, NOT on casino/hotel private property
- Don't block pedestrian traffic
- Don't litter — if someone drops it, pick it up (for optics and to avoid citations)
- No permit required for handbilling on public sidewalks in Clark County

## MEASURING SUCCESS

### What to Track

Since the QR links to `cloudeddeals.com?utm_source=flyer&utm_medium=qr&utm_campaign=vegas_strip_beta`:

- **Google Analytics / Netlify Analytics:** Filter by utm_campaign=vegas_strip_beta to see exact traffic from flyers
- **Scan volume by day:** Which distribution days/times drove the most scans?
- **Bounce rate from flyer traffic:** Do flyer users actually browse deals or immediately leave?
- **Return visits:** Do flyer users come back the next day? (This is the real signal)

### Success Benchmarks for Guerilla Flyers

| Metric | Okay | Good | Great |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Scan rate (scans / flyers handed out) | 2-3% | 5-8% | 10%+ |
| Bounce rate from flyer traffic | <70% | <50% | <40% |
| Return visit rate (came back within 7 days) | 5% | 10% | 20%+ |
| Cost per new user | <$0.50 | <$0.20 | <$0.10 |

If you hand out 10,000 flyers and get 500+ scans (5%), that's a strong guerilla campaign. At $100 total cost, that's $0.20 per new user — very efficient for a beta.
